# 🎯 CV-Overlay Pro v0.1.12 (Sticky Aim)

> **✨ NO MORE JITTER**
> You noticed it switching back and forth between two enemies?
> Fixed.

## 🛠️ The Fix
-   **Sticky Targeting**: Once the AI locks onto a target, it "sticks" to it.
-   It won't swap to another target unless the new target is much better or the old one disappears.
-   Result: Super smooth tracking.

## 📦 How to Apply
1.  **Download v0.1.12**.
2.  **Restart** `start_overlay.bat`.
    *   *No need to delete dist folder this time (Backend fix).*

*Happy Hunting.* 🎯
