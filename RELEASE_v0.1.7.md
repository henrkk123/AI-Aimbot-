# 🚑 CV-Overlay Pro v0.1.7 (Production Stability Fix)

This update solves the "Nothing works" / "Blank Screen" issues by switching to a stable Production Mode.

## 🛠️ The Fixes
1.  **Overlay Fixed ("Atom Icon" Gone)**: We removed the "Developer Mode" connection that was failing. The app now compiles itself into a stable file before launching. It will no longer show a blank screen.
2.  **Training Fixed**: The training window logic was repaired (it was closing instantly). It now stays open.

## 📦 How to Run
1.  **Download v0.1.7**.
2.  Double-click `start_overlay.bat`.
    *   *Note: First launch might take 10-20 seconds to "Design Build". This is normal.*
3.  Double-click `train_model.bat`.

*This is the version that should just work.* 🤞
