# 🚑 CV-Overlay Pro v0.1.5 (CRITICAL WINDOWS FIX)

> **⚠️ WINDOWS CRASH FIX**
> The previous version had a syntax error that caused the launcher to close immediately for some users. This update fixes it.

## 🛠️ What was the bug?
-   A technical issue with comments (`::`) inside code blocks caused Windows to abort the script instantly.
-   We replaced them with standard comments. The scripts should now open correctly.

## 📦 How to Apply
1.  **Download v0.1.5** code.
2.  Run `start_overlay.bat`.

*Sorry for the trouble! Troubleshooting Windows scripts is tricky.* 😅
