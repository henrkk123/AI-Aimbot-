# 🚑 CV-Overlay Pro v0.1.3 (Training Hotfix)

This release fixes a crash when opening the Training UI.

## 🛠️ Fixes
-   **Training Fix**: Added `customtkinter`, `packaging`, and `pillow` to the auto-install list.
-   **Stability**: The training window should now open reliably on all systems.

## ❓ FAQ (Why "Localhost"?)
If you see **"Localhost"** in the black window (console):
> **Don't Worry!** This is normal.
> The app uses a "Local Server" to communicate between the AI Brain and the Visual Overlay faster than a normal app could.
> **It is NOT a website.** It is a high-performance local connection. YOU are the only one who can see it.
