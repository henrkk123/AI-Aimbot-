# 🚑 CV-Overlay Pro v0.1.8 (Visuals Fix)

> **✅ TRAINING IS FIXED**
> Thanks for confirming! Now let's fix the "Invisible Overlay" issue.

## 🛠️ The Fix
-   **Blank Screen Fix**: The overlay was technically "working" but couldn't find its own design files because of a wrong path setting (`./`).
-   **Security**: We unlocked the connection between the UI and the Brain so they can talk freely.

## 📦 How to Apply
1.  **Download v0.1.8**.
2.  Run `start_overlay.bat`.
    *   *If it's still blank, delete the `overlay-ui/dist` folder and run it again.*

## 💡 Note
You **DO NOT** need a trained model to see the overlay. You should see the menu immediately. If you see the menu, THEN you can train.
