# 🧠 CV-Overlay Pro v0.1.14 (Smart GPU Tool)

> **✨ NO MORE REDOWNLOADS**
> You hated that it re-downloaded 2GB every time you clicked it?
> Fixed.

## 🛠️ The Fix
-   **Smart Check**: `install_gpu.bat` now CHECKS if you have GPU support first.
    *   If yes -> It says "Great News" and stops.
    *   If no -> It installs it.
-   **Universal**: Renamed to support ALL RTX cards (30/40/50 series), not just your 5070.

## 📦 How to Apply
1.  **Download v0.1.14**.
2.  Replace `install_gpu.bat`.

*Now it's safe to click without watching a download bar for 10 minutes.* ⏱️
