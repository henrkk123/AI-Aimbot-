# 🧹 CV-Overlay Pro v0.1.4 (Force-Repair Update)

This update ensures all libraries are 100% installed, even if you upgraded from an old version.

## 🛠️ Critical Fixes
-   **Always-Check**: Launchers now check for `customtkinter` on *every* launch. It will auto-install it if missing.
-   **Factory Reset**: Added `reset_installation.bat`. If your folder is messy or broken, run this tool to wipe the settings and start fresh.

## 📦 How to Fix Your "Broken" Install
1.  **Download v0.1.4** code.
2.  (Optional) Run `reset_installation.bat` to clean up "thousands of old things".
3.  Run `start_overlay.bat`. It will force-install the missing libraries.
