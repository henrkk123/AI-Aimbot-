# 🚑 CV-Overlay Pro v0.1.6 (Training Loop Fix)

> **⚠️ TRAINING CRASH FIXED**
> The Training UI was missing its "main loop", causing it to open and close instantly. This is now fixed.

## 🛠️ Fixes
-   **GUI Loop**: Added the missing entry point code so the window actually stays open.
-   **Stability**: Removed potential threading conflicts.

## 📦 How to Apply
1.  **Download v0.1.6** code.
2.  Run `train_model.bat`.
3.  The window should now STAY OPEN.

*Thank you for your patience. Software development is hard, but we are getting there!* 🚀
