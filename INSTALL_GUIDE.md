## 🏗️ Phase 1: The Foundation (Prerequisites)

Before we can run high-end AI, we need the basics.

### 1. Install Python (The Brain)
We need Python 3.10 or newer.
1.  Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **Vital Step for Windows**: Check the box **"Add Python to PATH"** in the installer.
3.  Install it.

### 2. Install Node.js (The Graphics)
We need Node to run the "Liquid Glass" UI.
1.  Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  Download the **LTS Version** (Recommended).
3.  Install it with default settings.

## 🚀 Phase 2: Launch & Play

That's it! We built a **Smart Launcher** that handles the rest.

### For Mac 🍎
**Double-Click** `start_overlay.command`.
*   *Note: On the first run, it will say "Initializing Python Brain" and install everything. This takes 1-2 minutes.*

### For Windows 🪟
**Double-Click** `start_overlay.bat`.
*   *Note: It will automatically detect missing files and install them ("Healing System"). Just wait for it to finish!*

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Command not found" error?**
> You didn't add Python or Node to your PATH during installation (Phase 1). Reinstall them and check the boxes!

**Window closes immediately?**
> Check the `launcher_debug.log` file in the folder to see exactly what went wrong.
