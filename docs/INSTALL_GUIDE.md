## 🏗️ Phase 1: The Foundation (Prerequisites)

Before we start, we need to lay the groundwork.

### 1. Install Python (The Brain)
We need Python 3.10+.
1.  Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **⚠️ VITAL STEP**: Check the box **"Add Python to PATH"** in the installer.
3.  Install.

### 2. Install Node.js (The Graphics)
We need Node for the "Liquid Glass" overlay.
1.  Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  Download the **LTS Version**.
3.  Install default settings.

## ⚡ Phase 2: Activation (The "One-Time" Setup)

Only do this ONCE.

### 🪟 Windows Users (Critical for RTX 5070)
1.  **Run `install_gpu.bat`**.
    *   *What it does:* It deletes generic AI drivers and installs **NVIDIA CUDA 11.8** (The Golden Standard).
    *   *Why:* Without this, your AI runs on your CPU (Slow). With this, it uses your RTX 5070 (Instant).
    *   *Time:* ~5 minutes (Downloads 2GB).

### 🍎 Mac Users
1.  Skip this. Your **Apple Neural Engine** (MPS) is auto-detected.

## 🚀 Phase 3: Launch & Dominate

We have split the app into two parts: Aiming and Training.

### 🎯 To PLAY (The Aimbot)
1.  Double-click **`start_overlay.bat`** (Win) or **`start_overlay.command`** (Mac).
2.  Wait for **"VISION ENGINE: ONLINE"**.
3.  Press **`0` (Zero)** to toggle Combat Mode.

### 🧠 To LEARN (The Trainer)
1.  Double-click **`train_model.bat`**.
2.  Use the UI to select folders and train.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Bible

| Problem | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"0% GPU Usage"** | You didn't run `install_gpu.bat`. Do it now. |
| **"ModuleNotFoundError"** | Run `start_overlay.bat` once. It auto-heals missing files. |
| **"Black Screen"** | Wait 10 seconds. If nothing happens, press `Ctrl+R` (Reload). |
| **"Mouse floats/doesn't lock"** | You are on an old version. Download **v0.1.22+** (Raw Input Fix). |

Happy Hunting. 🎯
