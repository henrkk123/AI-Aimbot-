# 👻 CV-Overlay Pro v0.1.13 (Ghost Mode)

> **✨ 3RD PERSON FIX**
> You noticed it locking onto YOU (your own character/back)?
> Fixed.

## 🛠️ The Fix
-   **Player Deadzone**: I taught the AI to ignore the center-bottom of the screen where your character stands.
-   It will now look *past* you to find enemies, not AT you.

## 📦 How to Apply
1.  **Download v0.1.13**.
2.  **Restart** `start_overlay.bat`.

*Now you are invisible to your own aimbot.* 👻
