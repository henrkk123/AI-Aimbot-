# ⚡ CV-Overlay Pro v0.1.16 (Instant Launch)

> **✨ SPEED UPDATE**
> You asked to stop the constant "Installing..." checks.
> Fixed.

## 🛠️ The Fix for Speed
-   **Smart Check**: The launcher now checks if `Python` is ready in < 1 second.
-   **No More Waiting**: It skips the installation step if you already have the files.
    *   *Result*: Launch time dropped from ~2 minutes to ~3 seconds.

## 📦 How to Apply
1.  **Download v0.1.16**.
2.  Replace `start_overlay.bat`.

*Vroom.* 🏎️
