# 🦅 CV-Overlay Pro v0.1.27 (Bleeding Edge)

> **✨ RTX 50-SERIES SUPPORT**
> "SM_120 is not compatible?"
> That means your GPU is *too new*. Stable PyTorch doesn't know it exists yet.

## 🛠️ The Fix
-   **Nightly Build**: I switched the installer to download the **Preview Version** of PyTorch.
-   **CUDA 12.6**: This adds support for "Blackwell" chips (RTX 5070/5080/5090).

## 📦 How to Apply
1.  **Download v0.1.27**.
2.  Run `install_gpu.bat` **AGAIN**.
3.  It will download the "Nightly" wheels.
4.  Start Trainer.

*Welcome to the future. 🚀*
