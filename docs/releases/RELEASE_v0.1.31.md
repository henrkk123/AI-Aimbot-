# 🎯 CV-Overlay Pro v0.1.31 (Sticky Refined)

> **✨ AIM FIX**
> "Stop locking other things." & "Don't let go when I move."
> Copy.

## 🛠️ The Changes
-   **Tighter Confidence**: Raised threshold to `50%` (was 30%). It will ignore "maybe" targets now. It only shoots what it KNOWS.
-   **Wider Grip**: Increased Sticky Radius to `250px` (was 100px).
    -   *Old*: If you flicked fast, it lost the target.
    -   *New*: It holds on to the target even during fast movements.

## 📦 How to Apply
1.  **Download v0.1.31**.
2.  Launch `start_overlay.bat`. (No reinstall needed).
