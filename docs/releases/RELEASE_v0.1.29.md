# 🐍 CV-Overlay Pro v0.1.29 (The Python Fix)

> **✨ BRUTE FORCE PYTHON**
> "Batch files are stupid."
> I rewrote the installer in Python.

## 🛠️ The Change
-   `install_gpu.bat` no longer tries to run complicated commands.
-   It just launches `force_install.py`.
-   **Why?** Python handles web downloads and version checks way better than Windows CMD.
-   **Verification**: The script INSTANTLY tests if the GPU is working *before* it closes. You will know if it worked.

## 📦 How to Apply
1.  **Download v0.1.29**.
2.  Run `install_gpu.bat`.
3.  A new Python window will open and perform the surgery.

*If you see Green Text at the end, you won.* 🏆
