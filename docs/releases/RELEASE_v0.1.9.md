# ⚡ CV-Overlay Pro v0.1.9 (RTX 5070 Turbo Pack)

> **🚀 UNLOCK YOUR RTX 5070**
> Your logs showed "GPU 0G" (CPU Mode). That's like driving a Ferrari in first gear.
> This update fixes that.

## 🛠️ The Fix for Speed
-   **New Tool**: Added `install_gpu.bat`.
    *   Run this ONE TIME.
    *   It deletes the slow "CPU" version and forces the "NVIDIA CUDA" version.
-   **Training UI**: Now tells you if you are on CPU (⚠️) or GPU (✅).

## 📦 How to Apply
1.  **Download v0.1.9**.
2.  Run `install_gpu.bat`. (Wait for it to finish downloading ~2GB of drivers).
3.  Run `train_model.bat`.
    *   Look for "NVIDIA GPU" in the black window.
    *   Set Epochs to **50**.

*With a 5070, training should fly.* 🏎️💨
