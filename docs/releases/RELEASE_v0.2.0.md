# 🦅 CV-Overlay Pro v0.2.0 (ULTRA-PRECISION)

> **🚀 LATENCY ELIMINATED. PRECISION REFINED.**

## ⚡ DXCam Integration (Windows Only)
We've replaced standard screen capture with **DXCam**. 
- **Latency**: Reduced from ~20ms to **sub-5ms**.
- **CPU Usage**: Significantly lower due to direct memory access.
- **Fallthrough**: Automatically falls back to `mss` if DXCam isn't available.

## 🎯 Target Offset (Headshot/Chest Tuning)
A new slider has been added to the **⚙️ SETTINGS** menu.
- **Value -0.4 to -0.2**: Target the **Head/Neck**.
- **Value 0.0**: Target the **Center** of the body.
- **Value 0.2**: Target the **Lower Chest**.

## 🛡️ Blackwell Fixes
v0.2.0 inherits the Blackwell (RTX 50) stability patches from v0.1.39.

**INSTALLATION**: Run `UPDATE.bat` to install the new `dxcam` dependency.
