# 🎮 CV-Overlay Pro v0.1.11 (Combat HUD)

> **✨ VISUAL CONFIRMATION**
> You asked to be "sure" the hotkey works.
> Now the Overlay TELLS you.

## 🛠️ Changes
-   **HUD Update**: Added a "COMBAT: OFF / ON" indicator.
-   **Hotkey**: Press '0' -> The text changes instantly.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: HOW TO UPDATE
Because we changed the DESIGN, you need to force a rebuild.

1.  **Download v0.1.11**.
2.  **DELETE** the folder `overlay-ui/dist`. (Just throw it in the trash).
3.  Run `start_overlay.bat`.
    *   It will say "First time build..." and create the NEW design.

*Now you can see it working with your own eyes.* 👀
