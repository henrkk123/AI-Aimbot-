# 🦅 Neural Edge v0.4.0 (THE HUMANIZATION UPDATE)

> **"Be invisible. Be precise. Be the edge."**

## 📈 Humanized Movement (Stealth Mode)
Neural Edge no longer moves in robotic straight lines.
- **Bezier Jitter**: The engine now introduces subtle, non-linear variations in mouse movement.
- **Stealth**: This makes the aim assist appear significantly more human to behavioral anti-cheat systems.
- **Customizable**: Use the **Humanization (Stealth)** slider to adjust the intensity of the "natural" wiggle.

## 🧠 Smart Prioritization (Lock-On Logic)
Stop jumping between targets. 
- **Lock Stability**: The engine now gives a massive priority bonus to the target you are currently tracking. 
- **Reliability**: This prevents the "jitter" that happens when multiple enemies are close to each other.
- **Customizable**: Use the **Lock Stability (Priority)** slider to control how "sticky" the lock is to a single entity.

## 🛠️ Maintenance & Refinement
- **README Fixed**: All formatting issues and duplicate sections have been purged.
- **Persistence**: Humanization and Stability settings are now saved to `config.json`.

**INSTALLATION**: Run `UPDATE.bat` to sync the new movement math and logic controllers.
