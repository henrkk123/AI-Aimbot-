# 🎓 CV-Overlay Pro v0.1.17 (The Trainer Update)

> **✨ CONTROL IS YOURS**
> GPU showing 0%? Want to add more images to an existing model?
> Fixed.

## 🛠️ New Features
1.  **Force GPU Mode**:
    *   Added a dropdown menu to manually force **GPU (0)**.
    *   If it still says "CPU", then your PyTorch installation is broken (run `install_gpu.bat` again).
2.  **Fine-Tuning (Adding Datasets)**:
    *   Want to add new images to your old model?
    *   Click **"Select Base Model"** -> Choose your `best.pt`.
    *   Select your NEW dataset folder.
    *   Train! (It will now learn the new stuff ON TOP of the old stuff).

## 📦 How to Apply
1.  **Download v0.1.17**.
2.  Replace `gui_training.py` (or the whole folder).

*Make that 5070 sweat.* 💦
