# 🎯 CV-Overlay Pro v0.1.15 (Precision Tune)

> **✨ BALANCED TRACKING**
> You said Ghost Mode was "too safe" and missed some targets in chaos?
> I adjusted the sensitivity.

## 🛠️ The Fix for Chaos
-   **Lower Threshold**: The AI now locks onto enemies even if it's only 30% sure (instead of 50%).
    *   *Result*: It won't lose track when people run behind trees/fences.
-   **Smaller Deadzone**: I made the "Ghost Mode" smaller.
    *   *Result*: It ignores YOU, but hits enemies standing right next to you.

## 📦 How to Apply
1.  **Download v0.1.15**.
2.  **Restart** `start_overlay.bat`.

*This should feel much stickier and responsive.* ⚡
